Playwright is a powerful tool for browser automation and end-to-end testing. To ensure you get the most out of Playwright, here are some best practices:
  1. Organize Your Tests
Use a Clear Folder Structure: Organize your tests into logical folders (e.g., tests/login, tests/checkout).

Page Object Model (POM): Encapsulate page-specific logic in classes to make tests more maintainable and reusable.

Modularize Code: Break down reusable functions (e.g., login, navigation) into helper files or modules.

  2. Write Reliable and Maintainable Tests
Use Descriptive Test Names: Clearly describe what the test is verifying (e.g., test('should display error on invalid login')).

Avoid Hardcoding Values: Use environment variables or configuration files for dynamic data (e.g., URLs, credentials).

Leverage Selectors Wisely: Use stable, semantic selectors like data-testid or ARIA roles instead of brittle CSS selectors.

Avoid Flakiness: Use waitForSelector, waitForNavigation, or waitForTimeout judiciously to handle asynchronous behavior.

  3. Handle Asynchronous Operations
Use await Properly: Ensure all Playwright actions are awaited to avoid race conditions.

Avoid waitForTimeout: Prefer built-in waiting mechanisms like waitForSelector or waitForResponse over arbitrary timeouts.

Handle Network Requests: Use page.waitForResponse or page.waitForRequest to wait for specific API calls.
